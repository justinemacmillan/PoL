# Background:
    # CC will cause temperatures to increase, as a result, the North Sea (NS) will become less favourable for Atlantic cod and saithe; and more favourable for European seabass, sardines, and anchovies (Townhill et al., 2023) 
    
    # Idea: What if, instead of waiting for Seabass to migrate to NS, we introduced it artificially.
    
    # Models: NS; NS + seabass; NS + temperature; NS + seabass + temperature
    # Based on Julia Blanchard's NS model (90% weight of tot catch)
    
    # Question: how will adding seabass and/or increasing the temperature change the food web and ecosystem structure in the NS? Will the seabass compete with the cod?
    
    # hypothesis: Seabass and cod are both opportunistic piscivores, possible that they will eat each other more.
